# Super-Retina
Matlab script files for random noise stimulation of the retina.

## Overview

Included in this repository are all the files used in the experiments of my master thesis *The effect of transcranial random
noise stimulation of the human retina on visual perception*. The folder for experiment 4 also includes script files used in the analysis.

## How to use
### Prerequisites
 - Matlab Version 2019a or newer
 - Working [Psychtoolbox installation](http://psychtoolbox.org/)
 - Drivers for the National Instruments I/O device
 
### Installation
 - Download or clone the repository to your PC and add the Calibration and Functions folders to your Matlab $PATH.

### Usage
 - You can test your setup by running the script *experiment_check.m* found in every experiment folder.
 - To minimise manual input throughout an experiment session, you can use the respective metascript for each experiment. However, it is also possible to run each part of the experiment seperately.
